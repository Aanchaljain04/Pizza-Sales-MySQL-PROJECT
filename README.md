# Pizza Sales SQL Project

Welcome to the Pizza Sales SQL project! This repository hosts an end-to-end SQL project focused on analyzing pizza sales data. The project encompasses database creation, data querying, and deriving actionable insights from the dataset.

## About the Dataset
![ER-Diagram_Pizza_Sales](https://github.com/Aanchaljain04/Pizza-Sales-SQL-PROJECT/assets/47006604/4df19ee3-bafe-4e71-993a-bba956c13a0b)

The dataset utilized in this project pertains to the operations of a pizza company during the year 2023. The dataset is structured to facilitate comprehensive analysis, allowing us to extract valuable information regarding the company's performance, customer preferences, revenue trends, and more.

## Project Scope and Objectives

The primary objective of this project is to leverage SQL queries to explore, analyze, and derive insights from the provided pizza sales dataset. 
Key areas of focus include following things: 
- understanding sales trends
- identifying popular pizza types
- examining revenue generation patterns
- uncovering factors contributing to business success.
  
By systematically dissecting the dataset and conducting various SQL queries, we aim to extract actionable insights that can inform strategic decision-making and potentially drive business growth.

## Structure of the Repository

This repository is organized to facilitate a structured approach to the SQL project. The primary components include:

1. **Database Creation Scripts**: Contains SQL scripts responsible for creating the necessary database schema and tables to house the pizza sales data. (https://github.com/Aanchaljain04/Pizza-Sales-SQL-PROJECT/blob/main/Dump%20File.sql)

2. **SQL Queries**: Comprises a comprehensive set of SQL queries designed to address specific analysis objectives. Queries are structured, commented, and organized to ensure clarity and ease of understanding. (https://github.com/Aanchaljain04/Pizza-Sales-SQL-PROJECT/blob/main/SQL_Queries_pizza_sales_Project.sql)

3. **Insights and Findings**: Documentation of insights derived from the SQL analysis. This section presents key findings, trends, and observations uncovered through the exploration of the dataset.

4. **Documentation**: Supplementary documentation providing context, methodology, and any additional information relevant to the project.

## How to Use

To utilize this project effectively, follow these steps:

1. **Database Setup**: Execute the database creation scripts provided to set up the database environment.

2. **Run SQL Queries**: Execute the SQL queries included in the repository to perform various analyses on the dataset.

3. **Review Insights**: Explore the insights and findings section to gain a deeper understanding of the implications derived from the analysis.

4. **Further Analysis**: Feel free to extend the analysis by incorporating additional SQL queries or refining existing ones to explore specific aspects of interest.

By following these steps, you can effectively utilize the MySQL project for analyzing pizza sales data and extracting valuable insights to inform decision-making and strategy development.
